# Standard

Full-stack TypeScript boilerplate: moon + pnpm workspaces, Hono + oRPC, Drizzle, better-auth, React 19 + TanStack + Vite + Tailwind v4, Biome, Vitest, Playwright.

## Stack

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Monorepo | moon + pnpm workspaces |
| API | Hono, oRPC (typed RPC + REST/OpenAPI from one router), Effect for business logic |
| DB | Drizzle ORM + Postgres |
| Auth | better-auth, one role per user |
| Jobs | RabbitMQ + Redis |
| Mail | nodemailer over SMTP, mailpit in dev |
| Web | React 19, TanStack (Router, Query, Form, Store), Vite, Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui |
| Quality | Biome, Vitest, Playwright |

## Getting Started

Requires [moon](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/install) + [proto](https://moonrepo.dev/proto), or Node 24 / pnpm 11 directly.

```sh
pnpm install
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env # and apps/web/.env.example to apps/web/.env
make setup                            # docker services, migrate and seed
make up                               # start api + web together
```

The example files already match what `docker-compose.dev.yml` brings up, so they work unedited for local development. `apps/api/.env.example` is the full list of variables the API accepts, and `envSchema` rejects a missing or malformed one at boot rather than failing later in a request.

Or run them separately:

```sh
make api                              # api on :3001
make web                              # web on :5173
```

Seed logins: `admin@test.app` / `Password123`, `member@test.app` / `Password123`, `viewer@test.app` / `Password123`.

Mail sent in development is caught by mailpit, read it at `http://localhost:8025`.

## Version and Health

The root `package.json` version is the single source of truth for the workspace. `@app/version` re-exports it as `APP_VERSION` (a plain JSON import, no build step and no generated file), and both sides serve it:

| Surface | Response |
|---|---|
| `health.check` over RPC, `GET /api/health` | `{ status: "ok", version }` |
| `GET /healthz` | `{ status, version }`, liveness only: the process answers, nothing is probed |
| `GET /ready` | `{ status, version, dependencies }`, and **503** when any dependency is down |
| `/health` on the web (no auth) | its own version next to the API's |
| `GET /metrics` | Prometheus text: request counts and durations by method, matched route and status, plus process figures. Guarded by `METRICS_TOKEN`, and required to be in production. See [docs/operations/metrics.md](docs/operations/metrics.md) |

The shape is `healthSchema` in `@app/schemas`, so the web page is typed against what the API returns; the two versions differing means web and API are deployed out of step.

**Every change bumps the root version** in the same commit, so `/health` always names the build you are looking at: patch for a fix, chore or docs change, minor for a feature, major for a breaking change. Only the root version matters; the workspace packages are private and unpublished.

## Commands

Every command goes through `make` or `moon`; nothing shells into a package directory.

```sh
make help                             # every target, with a one-line description
make setup                            # services + migrate + seed
make services | services-stop         # docker: postgres, redis, rabbitmq, mailpit
make api | web | worker               # run one process
make db-migrate | db-seed | db-studio # database
make check | lint | test | build      # quality gates
make e2e                              # api + web end-to-end
make ci                               # everything CI runs, on affected projects
```

```sh
moon run :check                       # biome check (format + lint)
moon run :build                       # tsc --noEmit, every project
moon run :test                        # unit tests
moon run api:db-generate              # generate drizzle migration
moon ci                               # what CI runs
```

## Releasing

Trunk-based development on `trunk`. Branches are short-lived, branch off `trunk`, and squash-merge once CI is green. Pre-push hooks run biome and the typecheck plus unit tests via lefthook. Dependabot keeps deps current.

`trunk` is protected and the rules apply to admins too:

| Rule | Effect |
|---|---|
| Pull request required | No direct pushes to `trunk`; 0 approvals required, so you can merge your own once CI is green |
| 3 required checks, strict | `Check, test, build (affected)`, `E2E (api + web)` and `Drizzle schema drift check` must pass, and the branch must be up to date with `trunk` |
| Linear history, squash-only | Merge commits and rebase merges are disabled at the repo level |
| Branch auto-deleted on merge | Keeps the branch list honest about what is in flight |
| No force pushes or deletions | Applies to everyone, including admins |

`E2E (api + web)` is a gate rather than a suite: the API and the web suites run as two parallel jobs and the gate reports their combined result, so the required check keeps one name. Both suites are skipped when a change touches only Markdown, documentation and the root version, which is why a documentation pull request goes green in seconds.

A branch that has fallen behind must be rebased on `trunk` and re-pushed; that is what keeps the history linear and every commit on `trunk` CI-green.

PRs use `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. Fill every section in place, writing "None" rather than deleting one. Reviews use `.github/PULL_REQUEST_REVIEW_TEMPLATE.md` and always cover three sections: **Functional** (correctness, and whether every Changelog bullet is actually implemented), **Clean Code** (the conventions in `.claude/skills/ts-conventions/SKILL.md`, plus duplication and naming), and **Feature Suggestions** (non-blocking, each tagged `this-pr` or `follow-up`). Findings in the first two carry a P0–P3 severity from the template's legend.

Releases are automatic and there is nothing to run by hand: every merge to `trunk` carries a version bump, and the workflow tags that commit once its checks are green. The notes are lifted from each PR's Changelog section rather than from commit subjects, which is why that section is written for whoever reads the release page. How it is assembled, and how to re-run a publish that failed, are in [docs/operations/deployment.md](docs/operations/deployment.md).
