# Alerting

An alert without a named owner is a notification nobody acts on, so every alert below names one. `fradotech` is the default owner and receives anything not reassigned. Reassign by editing the row, not by adding a second name: two owners means neither of them is.

## What pages

| Alert | Condition | Severity | Runbook | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| API not ready | `GET /ready` non-200 for 2 minutes on any replica | Page | [Readiness is failing](runbooks.md#readiness-is-failing) | fradotech |
| API down | `GET /healthz` unreachable for 2 minutes | Page | [A deploy made things worse](runbooks.md#a-deploy-made-things-worse) | fradotech |
| Postgres unreachable | Readiness reports `database` down, or the server refuses connections | Page | [Postgres is unreachable](runbooks.md#postgres-is-unreachable) | fradotech |
| Error rate | 5xx above 2% of requests over 5 minutes | Page | Start from the request log, filter by `reqId` | fradotech |
| Redis unreachable | Readiness reports `cache` down for 5 minutes | Ticket | [Redis is unreachable](runbooks.md#redis-is-unreachable) | fradotech |
| Dead letter queue non-empty | `<queue>.dlq` depth above 0 for 15 minutes | Ticket | [Jobs are piling up](runbooks.md#jobs-are-piling-up-in-the-dead-letter-queue) | fradotech |
| Queue backlog | Main queue depth above 1000, or rising for 30 minutes | Ticket | [Jobs are not being processed](runbooks.md#jobs-are-not-being-processed-at-all) | fradotech |
| Mail send failures | Any `mail.send.failed` log event in 15 minutes | Ticket | [Password reset emails are not arriving](runbooks.md#password-reset-emails-are-not-arriving) | fradotech |
| Job consumer failures | Any `job.consume.failed` log event in 15 minutes | Ticket | [A job could not be consumed at all](runbooks.md#a-job-could-not-be-consumed-at-all) | fradotech |
| Session resolution failures | Any `session.resolve.failed` log event in 5 minutes | Page | [Everyone appears to be signed out](runbooks.md#everyone-appears-to-be-signed-out) | fradotech |
| Backup missing | No successful dump in 26 hours | Ticket | [backup-restore.md](backup-restore.md) | fradotech |
| Restore drill overdue | No recorded drill in 100 days | Ticket | [The drill](backup-restore.md#the-drill) | fradotech |

**Page** means wake someone. **Ticket** means it waits for working hours. Anything that cannot be sorted into one of those two does not belong on this list.

A single default owner is honest for a team of this size, and it is better than an empty column, but it is not a rota. Once a second person shares the pager, split the rows by the system each person knows best rather than round-robining them.

## Why these thresholds

The two minute windows on readiness and liveness are longer than a rolling deploy takes to move a single replica, so a normal deploy does not page anyone. The dead-letter alert waits 15 minutes because a single poison message during a deploy is common and self-resolves once the deploy finishes; a depth that is still climbing after 15 minutes is a real handler bug.

The mail alert fires on a single failure rather than a rate, because the failure it exists to catch is silent by design: a password reset that cannot be sent still answers the user with success, so that they cannot learn whether an address is registered. Nobody finds out from the product that it failed, which makes one line in a log the only signal there is.

The backup alert fires at 26 hours rather than 24 so that a nightly job which merely ran late does not page. The restore drill alert at 100 days gives most of a quarter of slack against the quarterly target.

## What is not wired yet

The error rate and latency alerts now have a source. `GET /metrics` serves `http_requests_total` and `http_request_duration_seconds` labelled by method, matched route and status, so the 2% threshold above is a query rather than a log search. See [metrics.md](metrics.md) for what is exposed and the token that guards it. What is still missing is a Prometheus that scrapes it, which is a hosting decision rather than code.

Readiness and liveness alerts stay HTTP probes against `/ready` and `/healthz`, because a process too sick to answer a probe is also too sick to be scraped.

Queue depth, dead letter depth and backup age are not application metrics and are not exposed here. They come from the broker's own metrics and from whatever runs the backup. The mail alert stays a log rule, because `mail.send.failed` carries the template that failed and a counter would lose it.

Tracing is wired but off until `TRACING_ENDPOINT` names a collector. Once it does, a request log line carries the `traceId` that leads to the trace, which is the path from an alert to a single slow request.
